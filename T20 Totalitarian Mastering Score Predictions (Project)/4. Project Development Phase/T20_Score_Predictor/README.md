## T20 World Cup Score Predictor: Project Overview

The T20 World Cup Score Prediction project aims to utilize the XGBoost algorithm to forecast the total runs scored by a cricket team in a T20 match. XGBoost, known for its effectiveness in predictive analysis, is chosen for this task.

### Workflow Breakdown:

- **Collecting Data:** Gather historical T20 cricket match data including team details, runs, wickets, and overs from diverse cricket databases or reputable websites.

- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the data to ensure accuracy, handling missing values, and engineering features.

- **Feature Selection:** Identify key features using correlation analysis and domain knowledge.

- **Model Training:** Train an XGBoost model using the preprocessed data.

- **Model Evaluation:** Assess model performance using metrics like mean absolute error and R-squared.

- **Making Predictions:** Utilize the trained XGBoost model to predict total runs scored by a team in a T20 match based on relevant features.
